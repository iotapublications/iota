This is what an about page is for, right?

That's all there is to it, at any rate; we are a small blog, with few articles and fewer authors. Small, however, in the same way that 'i' is small - there are billions of people in the world, and yet, for you and for each of us, there is only one I. There are billions of articles on the internet, but there is only one, 'extremely small' iota.
